abstract = {BACKGROUND The infectivity of the HIV-1 acute phase has been directly measured only once, from a retrospectively identified cohort of serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Rakai, Uganda. Analyses of this cohort underlie the widespread view that the acute phase is highly infectious, even more so than would be predicted from its elevated viral load, and that transmission occurring shortly after infection may therefore compromise interventions that rely on diagnosis and treatment, such as antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TasP). Here, we re-estimate the duration and relative infectivity of the acute phase, while accounting for several possible sources of bias in published estimates, including the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and unmeasured heterogeneity in risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS We estimated acute phase infectivity using two approaches. First, we combined viral load trajectories and viral load-infectivity relationships to estimate infectivity trajectories over the course of infection, under the assumption that elevated acute phase infectivity is caused by elevated viral load alone. Second, we estimated the relative hazard of transmission during the acute phase versus the chronic phase (RHacute) and the acute phase duration (dacute) by fitting a couples transmission model to the Rakai retrospective cohort using approximate Bayesian computation. Our model fit the data well and accounted for characteristics overlooked by previous analyses, including individual heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility and the retrospective cohort's exclusion of couples that were recorded as serodiscordant only once before being censored by loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or study termination. Finally, we replicated two highly cited analyses of the Rakai data on simulated data to identify biases underlying the discrepancies between previous estimates and our own. From the Rakai data, we estimated RHacute = 5.3 (95{\%} credibility interval [95{\%} CrI]: 0.79-57) and dacute = 1.7 mo (95{\%} CrI: 0.55-6.8). The wide credibility intervals reflect an inability to distinguish a long, mildly infectious acute phase from a short, highly infectious acute phase, given the 10-mo Rakai observation intervals. The total additional risk, measured as excess hazard-months attributable to the acute phase (EHMacute) can be estimated more precisely: EHMacute = (RHacute - 1) × dacute, and should be interpreted with respect to the 120 hazard-months generated by a constant untreated chronic phase infectivity over 10 y of infection. From the Rakai data, we estimated that EHMacute = 8.4 (95{\%} CrI: -0.27 to 64). This estimate is considerably lower than previously published estimates, and consistent with our independent estimate from viral load trajectories, 5.6 (95{\%} confidence interval: 3.3-9.1). We found that previous overestimates likely stemmed from failure to account for risk heterogeneity and bias resulting from the retrospective cohort study design. Our results reflect the interaction between the retrospective cohort exclusion criteria and high (47{\%}) rates of censorship amongst incident serodiscordant couples in the Rakai study due to loss to follow-up, couple dissolution, or study termination. We estimated excess physiological infectivity during the acute phase from couples data, but not the proportion of transmission attributable to the acute phase, which would require data on the broader population's sexual network structure. CONCLUSIONS Previous EHMacute estimates relying on the Rakai retrospective cohort data range from 31 to 141. Our results indicate that these are substantial overestimates of HIV-1 acute phase infectivity, biased by unmodeled heterogeneity in transmission rates between couples and by inconsistent censoring. Elevated acute phase infectivity is therefore less likely to undermine TasP interventions than previously thought. Heterogeneity in infectiousness and susceptibility may still play an important role in intervention success and deserves attention in future analyses.},

Recent evidence has begun to shed light on the origin of primate SDs, pointing to a complex interplay of mechanisms and indicating that distinct waves of duplication took place during primate evolution. There is also evidence for a strong association between duplication, genomic instability and large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Exciting new findings suggest that SDs have not only created novel primate gene families, but might have also influenced current human genic and phenotypic variation on a previously unappreciated scale. A growing number of examples link natural human genetic variation of these regions to susceptibility to common disease.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic techniques are increasingly applied to infer the somatic mutational history of a tumor from DNA sequencing data. However, standard phylogenetic tree reconstruction techniques do not account for the fact that bulk sequencing data measures mutations in a population of cells. We formulate and solve the multi-state perfect phylogeny mixture deconvolution problem of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree given mixtures of its leaves, under the multi-state perfect phylogeny, or infinite alleles model. Our somatic phylogeny reconstruction using combinatorial enumeration (SPRUCE) algorithm uses this model to construct phylogenetic trees jointly from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy-number aberrations (CNAs). We show that SPRUCE addresses complexities in simultaneous analysis of SNVs and CNAs. In particular, there are often many possible phylogenetic trees consistent with the data, but the ambiguity decreases considerably with an increasing number of samples. These findings have implications for tumor sequencing strategies, suggest caution in drawing strong conclusions based on a single tree reconstruction, and explain difficulties faced by applying existing phylogenetic techniques to tumor sequencing data.},

@article{Aldous2001,
abstract = {In 1924 Yule observed that distributions of number of species per genus were typically long-tailed, and proposed a stochastic model to fit these data. Modern taxonomists often prefer to represent rela-tionships between species via phylogenetic trees; the counterpart to Yule's observation is that actual reconstructed trees look surprisingly unbalanced. The imbalance can readily be seen via a scatter diagram of the sizes of clades involved in the splits of published large phylogenetic trees. Attempting stochastic modeling leads to two puzzles. First, two somewhat opposite possible biological descriptions of what dominates the macroevolutionary process (adaptive radiation; " neutral " evolution) lead to exactly the same mathematical model (Markov or Yule or coalescent). Second, neither this nor any other simple stochastic model predicts the observed pattern of imbalance. This essay represents a probabilist's mus-ings on these puzzles, complementing the more detailed survey of biolog-ical literature by Mooers and Heard, Quart. Rev. Biol. 72 [(1997) 31–54]. Readers determined to get straight to the main point of this essay (phylogenetic tree imbalance) may skip to Section 3, but we hope that the historical context provided in Sections 1 and 2 will be helpful to most readers.},

abstract = {Phylogenies provide a usefulway to understand the evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral events is one of the first, essential goals with such data.However, current sophisticated probabilistic approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size. Here,we present very fast dating algorithms, based on a Gaussian model closely related to the Langley–Fitchmolecular-clockmodel.We showthat this model is robust to uncorrelated violations of themolecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled through times. They estimate the substitution rate and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for the root position, thus representing a new, practical alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g., midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the close relationships between least- squares and linear algebra.We distinguish between an unconstrained setting and the case where the temporal precedence constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With rooted trees, the former is solved using linear algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the latter, constrained setting, is based on an active-set method that runs in nearly linear time. With unrooted trees the computing time becomes (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large input trees ({\textgreater}10,000 taxa) can easily be processed and transformed into time-scaled trees.We compare these algorithms to standardmethods (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley–Fitchmethod, and BEAST). Using simulated data,we showthat their estimation accuracy is similar to that of themost sophisticated methods, while theircomputing time ismuch faster.We apply these algorithms on a large data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results showthat these algorithms provide a very fast alternative with results similar to those of other computer programs. These algorithms are implemented in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can be downloaded from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all our data sets and detailed results.

abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses are increasingly used in attempts to clarify transmission patterns of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but there is a continuing discussion about their validity because convergent evolution and transmission of minor HIV variants may obscure epidemiological patterns. Here we have studied a unique HIV-1 transmission cluster consisting of nine infected individuals, for whom the time and direction of each virus transmission was exactly known. Most of the transmissions occurred between 1981 and 1983, and a total of 13 blood samples were obtained approximately 2-12 years later. The p17 gag and env V3 regions of the HIV-1 genome were directly sequenced from uncultured lymphocytes. A true phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the knowledge about when the transmissions had occurred and when the samples were obtained. This complex, known HIV-1 transmission history was compared with reconstructed molecular trees, which were calculated from the DNA sequences by several commonly used phylogenetic inference methods [Fitch-Margoliash, neighbor-joining, minimum-evolution, maximum-likelihood, maximum-parsimony, unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA), and a Fitch-Margoliash method assuming a molecular clock (KITSCH)]. A majority of the reconstructed trees were good estimates of the true phylogeny; 12 of 13 taxa were correctly positioned in the most accurate trees. The choice of gene fragment was found to be more important than the choice of phylogenetic method and substitution model. However, methods that are sensitive to unequal rates of change performed more poorly (such as UPGMA and KITSCH, which assume a constant molecular clock). The rapidly evolving V3 fragment gave better reconstructions than p17, but a combined data set of both p17 and V3 performed best. The accuracy of the phylogenetic methods justifies their use in HIV-1 research and argues against convergent evolution and selective transmission of certain virus variants.},

Important parameters to consider when sequencing antibody repertoires include the methodology, the B-cell population and clinical characteristics of the individuals analysed, and the bioinformatic analysis. Although focused sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chains or complement determining regions can be utilized to monitor particular immune responses and B-cell malignancies, high-fidelity analysis of the full-length paired heavy and light chains expressed by individual B cells is critical for characterizing functional antibody repertoires. Bioinformatic identification of clonal antibody families and recombinant expression of representative members produces recombinant antibodies that can be used to identify the antigen targets of functional immune responses and to investigate the mechanisms of their protective or pathogenic functions. Integrated analysis of coexpressed functional genes provides the potential to further pinpoint the most important antibodies and clonal families generated during an immune response. Sequencing antibody repertoires is transforming our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer.

abstract = {Immunoglobulins are encoded by a large multigene system that undergoes somatic rearrangement and additional genetic change during the development of immunoglobulin-producing cells. Inducible antibody and antibody-like responses are found in all vertebrates. However, immunoglobulin possessing disulfide-bonded heavy and light chains and domain-type organization has been described only in representatives of the jawed vertebrates. High degrees of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence identity are evident when the segmental elements that constitute the immunoglobulin gene loci in phylogenetically divergent vertebrates are compared. However, the organization of gene loci and the manner in which the independent elements recombine (and diversify) vary markedly among different taxa. One striking pattern of gene organization is the "cluster type" that appears to be restricted to the chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) and limits segmental rearrangement to closely linked elements. This type of gene organization is associated with both heavy- and light-chain gene loci. In some cases, the clusters are "joined" or "partially joined" in the germ line, in effect predetermining or partially predetermining, respectively, the encoded specificities (the assumption being that these are expressed) of the individual loci. By relating the sequences of transcribed gene products to their respective germ-line genes, it is evident that, in some cases, joined-type genes are expressed. This raises a question about the existence and/or nature of allelic exclusion in these species. The extensive variation in gene organization found throughout the vertebrate species may relate directly to the role of intersegmental (V{\textless}=={\textgreater}D{\textless}=={\textgreater}J) distances in the commitment of the individual antibody-producing cell to a particular genetic specificity. Thus, the evolution of this locus, perhaps more so than that of others, may reflect the interrelationships between genetic organization and function.},

abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the “discrete gamma model,” uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called “fixed-rates model,” classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368–376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

abstract = {Effective population screening of HIV and prevention of HIV transmission are only part of the global fight against AIDS. Community-level effects, for example those aimed at thwarting future transmission, are potential outcomes of treatment and may be important in stemming the epidemic. However, current clinical trial designs are incapable of detecting a reduction in future transmission due to treatment. We took advantage of the fact that HIV is an evolving pathogen whose transmission network can be reconstructed using genetic sequence information to address this shortcoming. Here, we use an HIV transmission network inferred from recently infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Diego, California. We developed and tested a network-based statistic for measuring treatment effects using simulated clinical trials on our inferred transmission network. We explored the statistical power of this network-based statistic against conventional efficacy measures and find that when future transmission is reduced, the potential for increased statistical power can be realized. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate that the network statistic is able to detect community-level effects (e.g., reduction in onward transmission) of HIV treatment in a clinical trial setting. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a network-based statistical metric when investigating HIV treatment options as a method to reduce onward transmission in a clinical trial setting.},

abstract = {Mean-field deterministic epidemic models have been successful in uncovering several important dynamic properties of stochastic epidemic spreading processes over complex networks. In particular, individual-based epidemic models isolate the impact of the network topology on spreading dynamics. In this paper, the existing models are generalized to develop a class of models that includes the spreading process in multilayer complex networks. We provide a detailed description of the stochastic process at the agent level where the agents interact through different layers, each represented by a graph. The set of differential equations that describes the time evolution of the state occupancy probabilities has an exponentially growing state-space size in terms of the number of the agents. Based on a mean-field type approximation, we developed a set of nonlinear differential equations that has linearly growing state-space size. We find that the latter system, referred to as the generalized epidemic mean-field (GEMF) model, has a simple structure characterized by the elements of the adjacency matrices of the network layers and the Laplacian matrices of the transition rate graphs. Finally, we present several examples of epidemic models, including spreading of virus and information in computer networks and spreading of multiple pathogens in a host population .},

@article{Kimura1980,
abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differ-ences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or "tran-sition" type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimi-dine, the difference is called type I1 (or "transversion" type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = --(1/2) In {\{}(1 --2P --Q) {\~{}} z -{\~{}} {\}} . The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the syn-onymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is esti-mated by K' S = --(1/2) In (1 --2P --0.). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin se-quences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution. During the last few years, rapid sequencing of DNA has become feasible, and data on nucleotide sequences of various parts of the genome in diverse organisms have started to accumulate at an accelerated pace. Each new report on such sequences Contribution No. 1330 from the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, 411 Japan 0022--2844/80/0016/0111/{\~{}} 02.00 112 M. Kimura invites evolutionary considerations through comparative studies. Therefore, it is de-sirable if good statistical methods are established for estimating evolutionary distances between homologous sequences in terms of the number of nucleotide base substitutions. Recently, Miyata and Yasunaga (1980) proposed a new method for this purpose. Theil method consists in tracing, through successive one step changes, all the possible paths (restricted by the assumption of "the minimum substitution number") for each pair of codons compared, giving each step its due weight based on relative acceptance rates of amino acid substitutions. Using this method they succeeded in revealing some inter-esting properties of synonymous base substitutions. One drawback of their method, however, is that it is too tedious. The purpose of this note is to derive some simple formulae which enable us to ob-tain reliable estimates on the evolutionary distances between two nucleotide sequences compared. The present method of estimation is not only handy but also has the merit of incorporating the possibility that sometimes "transition" type substitutions may oc-cur more frequently than "transversion" type substitutions. Let us compare two homologous sequences and suppose that n nucleotide sites are involved. In what follows, we express sequences in terms of RNA codes, so that the four bases are designated by letters U, C, A and G. Now, we fix our attention on one of the n sites, and investigate how the homologous sites in two species differentiate from each other in the course of evolution, starting from a common ancestor T years back. Since there are 4 possibilities with respect to a base occupied at each site, there are 16 combinations of base pairs when the homol-ogous sites in two species are compared. These are listed in Table 1. For example, UU in the first line represents the case in which homologous sites in the first and sec-ond species are both occupied by base U. Similarly, UC in the second line represents the case in which homologous sites in the first and second species are occupied by U and C. Table 1. Types of nucleotide base pairs occupied at homologous sites in two species. Type I difference includes four cases in which both are purines or both are pyrimidines (line 2). Type II difference consists of eight cases in which one of the bases is a purine and the other is a pyri-midine (lines 3 and 4).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Peer norms influence the adoption of behavior changes to reduce risk for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. By experimentally intervening at a community level to modify risk behavior norms, it may be possible to promote generalized reductions in HIV risk practices within a population. METHODS: We trained persons reliably identified as popular opinion leaders among gay men in a small city to serve as behavior change endorsers to their peers. The opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. Before and after intervention, we conducted surveys of men patronizing gay clubs in the intervention city and in two matched comparison cities. RESULTS: In the intervention city, the proportion of men who engaged in any unprotected anal intercourse in a two-month period decreased from 36.9 percent to 27.5 percent (-25 percent from baseline), with a reduction from 27.1 percent to 19.0 percent (-30 percent from baseline) for unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Relative to baseline levels, there was a 16 percent increase in condom use during anal intercourse and an 18 percent decrease in the proportion of men with more than one sexual partner. Little or no change was observed among men in the comparison cities over the same period of time. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that employ peer leaders to endorse change may produce or accelerate population behavior changes to lessen risk for HIV infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The HPTN 052 trial confirmed that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can nearly eliminate HIV transmission from successfully treated HIV-infected individuals within couples. Here, we present the mathematical modeling used to inform the design and monitoring of a new trial aiming to test whether widespread provision of ART is feasible and can substantially reduce population-level HIV incidence. METHODS AND FINDINGS The HPTN 071 (PopART) trial is a three-arm cluster-randomized trial of 21 large population clusters in Zambia and South Africa, starting in 2013. A combination prevention package including home-based voluntary testing and counseling, and ART for HIV positive individuals, will be delivered in arms A and B, with ART offered universally in arm A and according to national guidelines in arm B. Arm C will be the control arm. The primary endpoint is the cumulative three-year HIV incidence. We developed a mathematical model of heterosexual HIV transmission, informed by recent data on HIV-1 natural history. We focused on realistically modeling the intervention package. Parameters were calibrated to data previously collected in these communities and national surveillance data. We predict that, if targets are reached, HIV incidence over three years will drop by {\textgreater}60{\%} in arm A and {\textgreater}25{\%} in arm B, relative to arm C. The considerable uncertainty in the predicted reduction in incidence justifies the need for a trial. The main drivers of this uncertainty are possible community-level behavioral changes associated with the intervention, uptake of testing and treatment, as well as ART retention and adherence. CONCLUSIONS The HPTN 071 (PopART) trial intervention could reduce HIV population-level incidence by {\textgreater}60{\%} over three years. This intervention could serve as a paradigm for national or supra-national implementation. Our analysis highlights the role mathematical modeling can play in trial development and monitoring, and more widely in evaluating the impact of treatment as prevention.},

abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Roughly 3 million people worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2007, but an estimated 6{\textperiodcentered}7 million were still in need of treatment and a further 2{\textperiodcentered}7 million became infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention efforts might reduce HIV incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate treatment with ART, and examined the conditions under which the HIV epidemic could be driven towards elimination. Methods: We used mathematical models to explore the effect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the HIV epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for HIV every year and starting people on ART immediately after they are diagnosed HIV positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all HIV transmission was heterosexual. Findings: The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with HIV are not receiving ART, to an elimination phase, in which most are on ART, within 5 years. It could reduce HIV incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of HIV to less than 1{\%} within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be US{\$}1{\textperiodcentered}7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease. Interpretation: Universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate ART, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major effect on severe generalised HIV/AIDS epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation. Funding: None. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Transmission lies at the interface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution within and among hosts and separates distinct selective pressures that impose differences in both the mode of diversification and the tempo of evolution. In the absence of comprehensive direct comparative analyses of the evolutionary processes at different biological scales, our understanding of how fast within-host HIV-1 evolutionary rates translate to lower rates at the between host level remains incomplete. Here, we address this by analyzing pol and env data from a large HIV-1 subtype C transmission chain for which both the timing and the direction is known for most transmission events. To this purpose, we develop a new transmission model in a Bayesian genealogical inference framework and demonstrate how to constrain the viral evolutionary history to be compatible with the transmission history while simultaneously inferring the within-host evolutionary and population dynamics. We show that accommodating a transmission bottleneck affords the best fit our data, but the sparse within-host HIV-1 sampling prevents accurate quantification of the concomitant loss in genetic diversity. We draw inference under the transmission model to estimate HIV-1 evolutionary rates among epidemiologically-related patients and demonstrate that they lie in between fast intra-host rates and lower rates among epidemiologically unrelated individuals infected with HIV subtype C. Using a new molecular clock approach, we quantify and find support for a lower evolutionary rate along branches that accommodate a transmission event or branches that represent the entire backbone of transmitted lineages in our transmission history. Finally, we recover the rate differences at the different biological scales for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, which is only compatible with the 'store and retrieve' hypothesis positing that viruses stored early in latently infected cells preferentially transmit or establish new infections upon reactivation.},

Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual.

The complex structure and history of these regions have precluded a global evolutionary analysis. Combining a modified A-Bruijn graph algorithm with comparative genome sequence data, we identify the origin of 4,692 ancestral duplication loci and use these to cluster 437 complex duplication blocks into 24 distinct groups. The sequence-divergence data between ancestral-derivative pairs and a comparison with the chimpanzee and macaque genome support a 'punctuated' model of evolution. Our analysis reveals that human segmental duplications are frequently organized around 'core' duplicons, which are enriched for transcripts and, in some cases, encode primate-specific genes undergoing positive selection. We hypothesize that the rapid expansion and fixation of some intrachromosomal segmental duplications during great-ape evolution has been due to the selective advantage conferred by these genes and transcripts embedded within these core duplications.},

It remains unclear whether treatment of acute HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy improves long-term clinical outcomes for the individual and current guidelines are not definitive in recommending therapy at this stage of infection. However, treatment of acute HIV infection may have short-term benefit on viral set point when compared to delayed therapy as well as reducing the risk of transmission to others. Herein we review the immunological and clinical literature to discuss whether we should treat acute HIV infection, both from the perspective of the individual HIV-infected patient and from the public health perspective. As transmission of drug-resistant HIV variants are of concern, we also review recent clinical trial data to provide recommendations for which specific antiretroviral treatment regimens should be considered for the treatment of acute HIV infection.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

abstract = {Background Sexually transmitted infections spread across contact networks. Partner elicitation and notification are commonly used public health tools to identify, notify, and offer testing to persons linked in these contact networks. For HIV-1, a rapidly evolving pathogen with low per-contact transmission rates, viral genetic sequences are an additional source of data that can be used to infer or refine transmission networks.   Methods and Findings The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene interviews individuals newly diagnosed with HIV and elicits names of sexual and injection drug using partners. By law, the Department of Health also receives HIV sequences when these individuals enter healthcare and their physicians order resistance testing. Our study used both HIV sequence and partner naming data from 1342 HIV-infected persons in New York City between 2006 and 2012 to infer and compare sexual/drug-use named partner and genetic transmission networks. Using these networks, we determined a range of genetic distance thresholds suitable for identifying potential transmission partners. In 48{\%} of cases, named partners were infected with genetically closely related viruses, compatible with but not necessarily representing or implying, direct transmission. Partner pairs linked through the genetic similarity of their HIV sequences were also linked by naming in 53{\%} of cases. Persons who reported high-risk heterosexual contact were more likely to name at least one partner with a genetically similar virus than those reporting their risk as injection drug use or men who have sex with men.   Conclusions We analyzed an unprecedentedly large and detailed partner tracing and HIV sequence dataset and determined an empirically justified range of genetic distance thresholds for identifying potential transmission partners. We conclude that genetic linkage provides more reliable evidence for identifying potential transmission partners than partner naming, highlighting the importance and complementarity of both epidemiological and molecular genetic surveillance for characterizing regional HIV-1 epidemics.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing is an increasingly common component of infectious disease outbreak investigations. However, the relationship between pathogen transmission and observed genetic data is complex, and dependent on several uncertain factors. As such, simulation of pathogen dynamics is an important tool for interpreting observed genomic data in an infectious disease outbreak setting, in order to test hypotheses and to explore the range of outcomes consistent with a given set of parameters. We introduce 'seedy', an R package for the simulation of evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seedy/). Our software implements stochastic models for the accumulation of mutations within hosts, as well as individual-level disease transmission. By allowing variables such as the transmission bottleneck size, within-host effective population size and population mixing rates to be specified by the user, our package offers a flexible framework to investigate evolutionary dynamics during disease outbreaks. Furthermore, our software provides theoretical pairwise genetic distance distributions to provide a likelihood of person-to-person transmission based on genomic observations, and using this framework, implements transmission route assessment for genomic data collected during an outbreak. Our open source software provides an accessible platform for users to explore pathogen evolution and outbreak dynamics via simulation, and offers tools to assess observed genomic data in this context.},

abstract = {-Three null models have been proposed to predict the relative frequencies of topologies ofphylogenetic trees. One null model assumes each distinguishable n-member tree is equally likely (proportional-to-distinguishable-arrangements model). A second model assumes that each topo-logical type is equally likely (equiprobable model). A third model assumes that the probability of each topological type is determined by random speciation (Markov model). We sampled published phylogenetic trees from three major groups of organisms: division Angiospermae, class Insecta, and superclass Tetrapoda. Our sampling was more restricted than previous studies and was designed to test whether observed topological frequencies were distinguishable from those predicted by the three null models. The pattern of evolution reflected in five-member phylogenetic trees is different from predictions of the equiprobable and Markov model but is indistinguishable from the pro-portional-to-distinguishable-arrangements model. This indicates that 1) speciation (and/or extinc-tion) is not equally likely among all taxa, even for small phylogenies; or 2) systematists' attempts at reconstructing small phylogenies are, on average, indistinguishable from those expected if they had merely selected a tree at random from the pool of all possible trees. The topology frequencies were not different among the three groups of organisms, suggesting that factors shaping patterns of speciation and extinction are consistent among major taxonomic groups.

abstract = {Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given a (not necessarily ultrametric) tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints that limit the diameter of each cluster, the sum of its branch lengths, or chains of pairwise distances. These three versions of the problem can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, a fact that has been known by computer scientists for two of these three criteria for decades. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU picking for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

We investigate the cost-effectiveness of various ART scale-up options in Uganda. METHODS: Individual-based HIV/ART model of Uganda, calibrated using history matching. 22 ART scale-up strategies were simulated from 2016 to 2030, comprising different combinations of six single interventions (1. increased HIV testing rates, 2. no CD4 threshold for ART initiation, 3. improved ART retention, 4. increased ART restart rates, 5. improved linkage to care, 6. improved pre-ART care). The incremental net monetary benefit (NMB) of each intervention was calculated, for a wide range of different willingness/ability to pay (WTP) per DALY averted (health-service perspective, 3{\%} discount rate). RESULTS: For all WTP thresholds above {\$}210, interventions including removing the CD4 threshold were likely to be most cost-effective. At a WTP of {\$}715 (1 x per-capita-GDP) interventions to improve linkage to and retention/re-enrolment in HIV care were highly likely to be more cost-effective than interventions to increase rates of HIV testing. At higher WTP ({\textgreater} {\~{}} {\$}1690), the most cost-effective option was 'Universal Test, Treat, and Keep' (UTTK), which combines interventions 1-5 detailed above. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support new WHO guidelines to remove the CD4 threshold for ART initiation in Uganda. With additional resources, this could be supplemented with interventions aimed at improving linkage to and/or retention in HIV care. To achieve the greatest reductions in HIV incidence, a UTTK policy should be implemented.},

abstract = {In January 2015, an outbreak of undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID) was recognized in rural Indiana. By September 2016, 205 persons in this community of approximately 4400 had received a diagnosis of HIV infection. We report results of new approaches to analyzing epidemiologic and laboratory data to understand transmission during this outbreak. HIV genetic distances were calculated using the polymerase region. Networks were generated using data about reported high-risk contacts, viral genetic similarity, and their most parsimonious combinations. Sample collection dates and recency assay results were used to infer dates of infection. Epidemiologic and laboratory data each generated large and dense networks. Integration of these data revealed subgroups with epidemiologic and genetic commonalities, one of which appeared to contain the earliest infections. Predicted infection dates suggest that transmission began in 2011, underwent explosive growth in mid-2014, and slowed after the declaration of a public health emergency. Results from this phylodynamic analysis suggest that the majority of infections had likely already occurred when the investigation began and that early transmission may have been associated with sexual activity and injection drug use. Early and sustained efforts are needed to detect infections and prevent or interrupt rapid transmission within networks of uninfected PWID. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In both epizoonotics, 1) not all primary cases were connected but at least one primary case was connected, 2) highly connected, small areas (nodes) accounted for most cases, 3) several classes of nodes were distinguished, and 4) the contact model, which assumed all primary cases were identical, captured half the number of cases identified by the connectivity model.

abstract = {The growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence databases resulting from drug resistance testing has motivated efforts using phylogenetic methods to assess how HIV spreads 1-4. Such inference is potentially both powerful and useful for tracking the epidemiology of HIV and the allocation of resources to prevention campaigns. We recently used simulation and a small number of illustrative cases to show that certain phylogenetic patterns are associated with different types of epidemiological linkage 5. Our original approach was later generalized for large next-generation sequencing datasets and implemented as a free computational pipeline 6. Previous work has claimed that direction and direct-ness of transmission could not be established from phylogeny because one could not be sure that there were no intervening or missing links involved 7-9. Here, we address this issue by investigating phylogenetic patterns from 272 previously identified HIV transmission chains with 955 transmission pairs representing diverse geography, risk groups, subtypes, and genomic regions. These HIV transmissions had known linkage based on epidemiological information such as partner studies, mother-to-child transmission, pairs identified by contact tracing, and criminal cases. We show that the resulting phylogeny inferred from real HIV genetic sequences indeed reveals distinct patterns associated with direct transmission contra transmissions from a common source. Thus, our results establish how to interpret phylogenetic trees based on HIV sequences when tracking who-infected-whom, when and how genetic information can be used for improved tracking of HIV spread. We also investigate limitations that stem from limited sampling and genetic time-trends in the donor and recipient HIV populations. The phylogenetic analysis of HIV sequences has become a popular method to reveal epidemiological patterns relevant to disease tracking as well as details about transmission. Epidemiological patterns include the fundamental transmission history, which is not possible to directly observe but underlies the observable HIV phylogeny. While it is attractive to assume that these are identical, they may in fact be markedly different 10,11. The main reason for the discrepancy between HIV phylogeny and transmission history is because HIV quickly diversifies in a host. The existence of a highly diverse HIV population also raises the question of how many variants may be transmitted. A highly diverse founding population makes it harder for the immune system to fight HIV, accelerates the time to AIDS 12-15 and increases the probability of transmitting drug-resistant variants and developing future resistance 16. Moreover, the efficacy of immunological-based prevention technologies is reduced 17 and epidemiological relationships are obscured 10,18. Transmission moves a limited number of viral particles from the population of the donor to a recipient 19-22. As HIV within-patient diversity can build up many-years-worth of genetic variation, transmission of even a few particles can represent a highly diverse founding population. Diversity then continues to accumulate 23 , and as the adaptive immune system activates, the diversification rate increases as HIV escapes this evolving pressure 24. Cohort studies of acutely infected persons have used early patterns of diversification to argue that the majority of HIV infections start with a single virus strain, Fig. 1 | Real examples of PP, PM and MM trees. The PP tree comes from a MTCT transmission, the PM tree from a known HET discordant couple transmission, and the MM tree from a HET common source transmission (two recipients from the same known donor source). Each tree shown was randomly selected from 30,000 Bayesian posterior phylogenies per epidemiological pair after burn-in, reconstructed with MrBayes 38 , where the topological class had {\textgreater} 95{\%} posterior support. The detected recipient lineages are labelled with an asterisk. HIV taxa from two epidemiologically linked hosts are separately red or blue. In the PP and PM trees, the population of the donor is in red. Subtype references are in grey. The subtype references correctly root the donor-recipient tree. In the PP and PM trees, the donor HIV population is paraphyletic, encompassing the HIV population of the recipient. In a PP tree, the HIV population of the recipient is polyphyletic; in this example, there are four detected clades. In a PM tree, there is only one detected clade in the recipient; therefore, the population in this recipient is monophyletic. In a MM tree, both the HIV populations in the patients are monophyletic.

abstract = {Species tree reconstruction is complicated by effects of Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS), commonly modeled by the multi-species coalescent model. While there has been substantial progress in developing methods that estimate a species tree given a collection of gene trees, less attention has been paid to fast and accurate methods of quantifying support. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to compute quartet-based support for each branch of a given species tree with regard to a given set of gene trees. We then show how the quartet support can be used in the context of the multi-species coalescent model to compute i) the local posterior probability that the branch is in the species tree and ii) the length of the branch in coalescent units. We evaluate the precision and recall of the local posterior probability on a wide set of simulated and biological data, and show that it has very high precision and improved recall compared to multi-locus bootstrapping. The estimated branch lengths are highly accurate when gene trees have little error, but are underestimated when gene tree estimation error increases. Computation of both branch length and local posterior probability is implemented as a new feature in ASTRAL.},

abstract = {Models of tree evolution have mostly focused on capturing the cladogenesis processes behind speciation. Processes that derive the evolution of genomic elements, such as repeats, are not necessarily captured by these existing models. In this article, we design a model of tree evolution that we call the dual-birth model, and we show how it can be useful in studying the evolution of short Alu repeats found in the human genome in abundance. The dual-birth model extends the traditional birth-only model to have two rates of propagation, one for active nodes that propagate often, and another for inactive nodes, that with a lower rate, activate and start propagating. Adjusting the ratio of the rates controls the expected tree balance. We present several theoretical results under the dual-birth model, introduce parameter estimation techniques, and study the properties of the model in simulations. We then use the dual-birth model to estimate the number of active Alu elements and their rates of propagation and activation in the human genome based on a large phylogenetic tree that we build from close to one million Alu sequences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission patterns of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) could relate to the structure of the underlying sexual contact network, whose features are therefore of interest to clinicians. Conventionally, we represent sexual contacts in a population with a graph, that can reveal the existence of communities. Phylogenetic methods help infer the history of an epidemic and incidentally, may help detecting communities. In particular, phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have revealed the existence of large transmission clusters, possibly resulting from within-community transmissions. Past studies have explored the association between contact networks and phylogenies, including transmission clusters, producing conflicting conclusions about whether network features significantly affect observed transmission history. As far as we know however, none of them thoroughly investigated the role of communities, defined with respect to the network graph, in the observation of clusters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The present study investigates, through simulations, community detection from phylogenies. We simulate a large number of epidemics over both unweighted and weighted, undirected random interconnected-islands networks, with islands corresponding to communities. We use weighting to modulate distance between islands. We translate each epidemic into a phylogeny, that lets us partition our samples of infected subjects into transmission clusters, based on several common definitions from the literature. We measure similarity between subjects' island membership indices and transmission cluster membership indices with the adjusted Rand index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Analyses reveal modest mean correspondence between communities in graphs and phylogenetic transmission clusters. We conclude that common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies. The rarely-fulfilled requirement that network communities correspond to clades in the phylogeny is their main drawback. Understanding the link between transmission clusters and communities in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs.},

abstract = {In modern applications of molecular epidemiology, genetic sequence data are routinely used to identify clusters of transmission in rapidly evolving pathogens, most notably HIV-1. Traditional 'shoe-leather' epidemiology infers transmission clusters by tracing chains of partners sharing epidemiological connections (e.g., sexual contact). Here, we present a computational tool for identifying a molecular transmission analog of such clusters: HIV-TRACE (TRAnsmission Cluster Engine). HIV-TRACE implements an approach inspired by traditional epidemiology, by identifying chains of partners whose viral genetic relatedness imply direct or indirect epidemiological connections. Molecular transmission clusters are constructed using codon-aware pairwise alignment to a reference sequence followed by pairwise genetic distance estimation among all sequences. This approach is computationally tractable and is capable of identifying HIV-1 transmission clusters in large surveillance databases comprising tens or hundreds of thousands of sequences in near real time, i.e., on the order of minutes to hours. HIV-TRACE is available at www.hivtrace.org and from github.com/veg/hivtrace, along with the accompanying result visualization module from github.com/veg/hivtrace-viz. Importantly, the approach underlying HIV-TRACE is not limited to the study of HIV-1 and can be applied to study outbreaks and epidemics of other rapidly evolving pathogens.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Phylogenetics is frequently used for studies of population-based HIV transmission. The purpose of this review is to highlight the current utilities and limitations of phylogenetics in HIV epidemiological research from sample collection through to data analysis. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of HIV phylogenies can provide critical information about HIV epidemics that are otherwise difficult to obtain through traditional study design such as transmission of drug-resistant virus, mixing between demographic groups, and rapidity of viral spread within populations. However, recent results from empirical and theoretical studies of HIV phylogenies challenge some of the key assumptions and interpretations from phylogenetic studies. Recent findings include lack of transmission bottlenecks in MSM and injection drug use epidemics, evidence for preferential transmission of HIV virus in heterosexual epidemics, and limited evidence that tree topologies correlate directly with underlying network structures. Other challenges include a lack of a standardized definition for a phylogenetic transmission cluster and biased or sparse sampling of HIV transmission networks. SUMMARY: Phylogenetics is an important tool for HIV research, and offers opportunities to understand critical aspects of the HIV epidemic. Like all epidemiological research, the methods used and interpretation of results from phylogenetic studies should be made cautiously with careful consideration.},

abstract = {In the past, 2 kinds of Markov models have been considered to describe protein sequence evolution. Codon-level models have been mechanistic with a small number of parameters designed to take into account features, such as transition-transversion bias, codon frequency bias, and synonymous-nonsynonymous amino acid substitution bias. Amino acid models have been empirical, attempting to summarize the replacement patterns observed in large quantities of data and not explicitly considering the distinct factors that shape protein evolution. We have estimated the first empirical codon model (ECM). Previous codon models assume that protein evolution proceeds only by successive single nucleotide substitutions, but our results indicate that model accuracy is significantly improved by incorporating instantaneous doublet and triplet changes. We also find that the affiliations between codons, the amino acid each encodes and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are main factors driving the process of codon evolution. Neither multiple nucleotide changes nor the strong influence of the genetic code nor amino acids' physicochemical properties form a part of standard mechanistic models and their views of how codon evolution proceeds. We have implemented the ECM for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis, and an assessment of its ability to describe protein evolution shows that it consistently outperforms comparable mechanistic codon models. We point out the biological interpretation of our ECM and possible consequences for studies of selection.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is pandemic, but its contemporary global transmission network has not been characterized. A better understanding of the properties and dynamics of this network is essential for surveillance, prevention, and eventual eradication of HIV. Here, we apply a simple and computationally efficient network-based approach to all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the global database, revealing a contemporary picture of the spread of HIV-1 within and between countries. This approach automatically recovered well-characterized transmission clusters and extended other clusters thought to be contained within a single country across international borders. In addition, previously undescribed transmission clusters were discovered. Together, these clusters represent all known modes of HIV transmission. The extent of international linkage revealed by our comprehensive approach demonstrates the need to consider the global diversity of HIV, even when describing local epidemics. Finally, the speed of this method allows for near-real-time surveillance of the pandemic's progression.},

abstract = {Alu elements are the most successful transposons in humans. They are 300-bp non-coding sequences transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and are expected to retrotranspose with the aid of reverse transcriptases of cellular origin. We previously showed that human LINEs can generate cDNA copies of any mRNA transcript by means of a retroposition process involving reverse transcription and integration by the LINE-encoded endonuclease and reverse transcriptase. Here we show mobility of marked Alu sequences in human HeLa cells with the canonical features of a retrotransposition process, including splicing out of an autocatalytic intron introduced into the marked sequence, target site duplications of varying lengths and integrations into consensus A-rich sequences. We further show that the poly-A stretch at the Alu 3' end is essential for mobility, that LINEs are required for transposition and that the rate of retroposition is 100-1,000 times higher for Alu transcripts than for control mRNAs, thus accounting for the high mutational activity of these elements observed in humans.},

abstract = {Summary In this article, we demonstrate a statistical method for fitting the parameters of a sophisticated network and epidemic model to disease data. The pattern of contacts between hosts is described by a class of dyadic independence exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs), whereas the transmission process that runs over the network is modeled as a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) epidemic. We fit these models to very detailed data from the 1861 measles outbreak in Hagelloch, Germany. The network models include parameters for all recorded host covariates including age, sex, household, and classroom membership and household location whereas the SEIR epidemic model has exponentially distributed transmission times with gamma-distributed latent and infective periods. This approach allows us to make meaningful statements about the structure of the population-separate from the transmission process-as well as to provide estimates of various biological quantities of interest, such as the effective reproductive number, R. Using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, we produce samples from the joint posterior distribution of all the parameters of this model-the network, transmission tree, network parameters, and SEIR parameters-and perform Bayesian model selection to find the best-fitting network model. We compare our results with those of previous analyses and show that the ERGM network model better fits the data than a Bernoulli network model previously used. We also provide a software package, written in R, that performs this type of analysis.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen progress in the development of statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission trees ("who infected whom") from epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.},

abstract = {Transmission events are the fundamental building blocks of the dynamics of any infectious disease. Much about the epidemiology of a disease can be learned when these individual transmission events are known or can be estimated. Such estimations are difficult and generally feasible only when detailed epidemiological data are available. The genealogy estimated from genetic sequences of sampled pathogens is another rich source of information on transmission history. Optimal inference of transmission events calls for the combination of genetic data and epidemiological data into one joint analysis. A key difficulty is that the transmission tree, which describes the transmission events between infected hosts, differs from the phylogenetic tree, which describes the ancestral relationships between pathogens sampled from these hosts. The trees differ both in timing of the internal nodes and in topology. These differences become more pronounced when a higher fraction of infected hosts is sampled. We show how the phylogenetic tree of sampled pathogens is related to the transmission tree of an outbreak of an infectious disease, by the within-host dynamics of pathogens. We provide a statistical framework to infer key epidemiological and mutational parameters by simultaneously estimating the phylogenetic tree and the transmission tree. We test the approach using simulations and illustrate its use on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The approach unifies existing methods in the emerging field of phylodynamics with transmission tree reconstruction methods that are used in infectious disease epidemiology.},

abstract = {A wide range of evolutionary models for species-level (and higher) diversification have been developed. These models can be used to test evolutionary hypotheses and provide comparisons with phylogenetic trees constructed from real data. To carry out these tests and comparisons, it is often necessary to sample, or simulate, trees from the evolutionary models. Sampling trees from these models is more complicated than it may appear at first glance, necessitating careful consideration and mathematical rigor. Seemingly straightforward sampling methods may produce trees that have systematically biased shapes or branch lengths. This is particularly problematic as there is no simple method for determining whether the sampled trees are appropriate. In this paper, we show why a commonly used simple sampling approach (SSA)-simulating trees forward in time until n species are first reached-should only be applied to the simplest pure birth model, the Yule model. We provide an alternative general sampling approach (GSA) that can be applied to most other models. Furthermore, we introduce the constant-rate birth-death model sampling approach, which samples trees very efficiently from a widely used class of models. We explore the bias produced by SSA and identify situations in which this bias is particularly pronounced. We show that using SSA can lead to erroneous conclusions: When using the inappropriate SSA, the variance of a gradually evolving trait does not correlate with the age of the tree; when the correct GSA is used, the trait variance correlates with tree age. The algorithms presented here are available in the Perl Bio::Phylo package, as a stand-alone program TreeSample, and in the R TreeSim package.},

abstract = {As sequence data sets used for the investigation of pathogen transmission patterns increase in size, automated tools and standardized methods for cluster analysis have become necessary. We have developed an automated Cluster Picker which identifies monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria for bootstrap support and maximum genetic distance within large phylogenetic trees. A second tool, the Cluster Matcher, automates the process of linking genetic data to epidemiological or clinical data, and matches clusters between runs of the Cluster Picker. We explore the effect of different bootstrap and genetic distance thresholds on clusters identified in a data set of publicly available HIV sequences, and compare these results to those of a previously published tool for cluster identification. To demonstrate their utility, we then use the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher together to investigate how clusters in the data set changed over time. We find that clusters containing sequences from more than one UK location at the first time point (multiple origin) were significantly more likely to grow than those representing only a single location. The Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher can rapidly process phylogenetic trees containing tens of thousands of sequences. Together these tools will facilitate comparisons of pathogen transmission dynamics between studies and countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We estimated rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmission per coital act in HIV-discordant couples by stage of infection in the index partner. METHODS We retrospectively identified 235 monogamous, HIV-discordant couples in a Ugandan population-based cohort. HIV transmission within pairs was confirmed by sequence analysis. Rates of transmission per coital act were estimated by the index partner's stage of infection (recent seroconversion or prevalent or late-stage infection). The adjusted rate ratio of transmission per coital act was estimated by multivariate Poisson regression. RESULTS The average rate of HIV transmission was 0.0082/coital act (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.0039-0.0150) within approximately 2.5 months after seroconversion of the index partner; 0.0015/coital act within 6-15 months after seroconversion of the index partner (95{\%} CI, 0.0002-0.0055); 0.0007/coital act (95{\%} CI, 0.0005-0.0010) among HIV-prevalent index partners; and 0.0028/coital act (95{\%} CI, 0.0015-0.0041) 6-25 months before the death of the index partner. In adjusted models, early- and late-stage infection, higher HIV load, genital ulcer disease, and younger age of the index partner were significantly associated with higher rates of transmission. CONCLUSIONS The rate of HIV transmission per coital act was highest during early-stage infection. This has implications for HIV prevention and for projecting the effects of antiretroviral treatment on HIV transmission.},

abstract = {The processes of gene duplication, loss, and lineage sorting can result in incongruence between the phylogenies of genes and those of species. This incongruence complicates the task of inferring the latter from the former. We describe the use of reconciled trees to reconstruct the history of a gene tree with respect to a species tree. Reconciled trees allow the history of the gene tree to be visualized and also quantify the relationship between the two trees. The cost of a reconciled tree is the total number of duplications and gene losses required to reconcile a gene tree with its species tree. We describe the use of heuristic searches to find the species tree which yields the reconciled tree with the lowest cost. This method can be used to infer species trees from one or more gene trees. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Background Defaulting from treatment remains a challenge for most tuberculosis control programmes. It may increase the risk of drug resistance, relapse, death, and prolonged infectiousness. The aim of this study was to determine factors predicting treatment adherence among smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. A cohort of smear-positive tuberculosis patients diagnosed and registered in Hossana Hospital in southern Ethiopia from 1 September 2002 to 30 April 2004 were prospectively included. Using a structured questionnaire, potential predictor factors for defaulting from treatment were recorded at the beginning of treatment, and patients were followed up until the end of treatment. Default incidence rate was calculated and compared among preregistered risk factors. Of the 404 patients registered for treatment, 81 (20{\%}) defaulted from treatment. A total of 91{\%} (74 of 81) of treatment interruptions occurred during the continuation phase of treatment. On a Cox regression model, distance from home to treatment centre (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 2.97; p , 0.001), age . 25 y (HR ¼ 1.71; p ¼ 0.02), and necessity to use public transport to get to a treatment centre (HR ¼ 1.59; p ¼ 0.06) were found to be independently associated with defaulting from treatment. Conclusions Defaulting due to treatment noncompletion in this study setting is high, and the main determinants appear to be factors related to physical access to a treatment centre. The continuation phase of treatment is the most crucial time for treatment interruption, and future interventions should take this factor into consideration.},

abstract = {Estimating rates of speciation and extinction, and understanding how and why they vary over evolutionary time, geographical space and species groups, is a key to understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes generate biological diversity. Such inferences will increasingly benefit from phylogenetic approaches given the ever-accelerating rates of genetic sequencing. In the last few years, models designed to understand diversification from phylogenetic data have advanced significantly. Here, I review these approaches and what they have revealed about diversification in the natural world. I focus on key distinctions between different models, and I clarify the conclusions that can be drawn from each model. I identify promising areas for future research. A major challenge ahead is to develop models that more explicitly take into account ecology, in particular the interaction of species with each other and with their environment. This will not only improve our understanding of diversification; it will also present a new perspective to the use of phylogenies in community ecology, the science of interaction networks and conservation biology, and might shift the current focus in ecology on equilibrium biodiversity theories to non-equilibrium theories recognising the crucial role of history.},

abstract = {Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modelling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first three months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation {\textgreater} 90{\%}), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods' development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.},

Phylogenetic analysis can be a valid approach for the identification of transmission chains, and very-large data sets can be analysed through parallel computation. Here we propose and validate a new methodology for the partition of large-scale phylogenies and the inference of transmission clusters. This approach, on the basis of a depth-first search algorithm, conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. The method has been applied to identify transmission clusters of a phylogeny of 11,541 human immunodeficiency virus-1 subtype B pol gene sequences from a large Italian cohort. Molecular transmission chains were characterized by means of different clinical/demographic factors, such as the interaction between male homosexuals and male heterosexuals. Our method takes an advantage of a flexible notion of transmission cluster and can become a general framework to analyse other epidemics.},

abstract = {Models of codon evolution have attracted particular interest because of their unique capabilities to detect selection forces and their high fit when applied to sequence evolution. We described here a novel approach for modeling codon evolution, which is based on Kronecker product of matrices. The 61 × 61 codon substitution rate matrix is created using Kronecker product of three 4 × 4 nucleotide substitution matrices, the equilibrium frequency of codons, and the selection rate parameter. The entities of the nucleotide substitution matrices and selection rate are considered as parameters of the model, which are optimized by maximum likelihood. Our fully mechanistic model allows the instantaneous substitution matrix between codons to be fully estimated with only 19 parameters instead of 3,721, by using the biological interdependence existing between positions within codons. We illustrate the properties of our models using computer simulations and assessed its relevance by comparing the AICc measures of our model and other models of codon evolution on simulations and a large range of empirical data sets. We show that our model fits most biological data better compared with the current codon models. Furthermore, the parameters in our model can be interpreted in a similar way as the exchangeability rates found in empirical codon models.},

This result is based on a particular set of branch lengths produced by the common coalescent, where pendant branches leading to tips can be very short compared to branches deeper in the tree. Here, we analyze alternative and more realistic Yule and birth-death models. We show how censoring at the present both makes average branches one half what we might expect and makes pendant and interior branches roughly equal in length. Although dependent on whether we condition on the size of the tree, its age, or both, these results hold both for the Yule model and for birth-death models with moderate extinction. Importantly, the rough equivalency in interior and exterior branch lengths means the loss of evolutionary history with loss of species can be roughly linear. Under these models, the Tree of Life may offer limited redundancy in the face of ongoing species loss.},

abstract = {We used simulations to compare the relative power of eight statistical tests to detect im-balance in phylogenies that is too great to be ascribed to an equal-rates Markov null model. Three of these tests have never had their power assessed before. Our simulations are the first to assess perfor-mance under scenarios in which the speciation rates of various lineages can evolve independently. In one of the scenarios explored, rates depend upon the value of an evolving trait, whereas in the other the probability that a species will speciate declines with the time since it last did so. The results indicate that the relative performance of the methods depends upon how the imbalance is generated. Different types of processes lead to different imbalance signatures, i.e., different patterns of imbalance at different depths in the phylogeny, and the measures of tree shape differ in the depth of phylogeny at which they are most sensitive. Relative performance is also affected by tree size but does not appear to depend greatly upon the degree of speciation rate variation among lineages. Two of the indices (Colless's index I and Shao and Sokal's N) show reasonable performance throughout, but another (Shao and Sokal's B2) is never indicated to be a preferred method. Two tests that do not require com-pletely resolved phylogenies, mean I' and mean Il, have reasonable power.},

@article{Romero-Severson2014,
abstract = {Pathogen phylogenies are often used to infer spread among hosts. There is, however, not an exact match between the pathogen phylogeny and the host transmission history. Here, we examine in detail the limitations of this relationship. First, all splits in a pathogen phylogeny of more than 1 host occur within hosts, not at the moment of transmission, predating the transmission events as described by the pretransmission interval. Second, the order in which nodes in a phylogeny occur may be reflective of the within-host dynamics rather than epidemiologic relationships. To investigate these phenomena, motivated by within-host diversity patterns, we developed a two-phase coalescent model that includes a transmission bottleneck followed by linear outgrowth to a maximum population size followed by either stabilization or decline of the population. The model predicts that the pretransmission interval shrinks compared with predictions based on constant population size or a simple transmission bottleneck. Because lineages coalesce faster in a small population, the probability of a pathogen phylogeny to resemble the transmission history depends on when after infection a donor transmits to a new host. We also show that the probability of inferring the incorrect order of multiple transmissions from the same host is high. Finally, we compare time of HIV-1 infection informed by genetic distances in phylogenies to independent biomarker data, and show that, indeed, the pretransmission interval biases phylogeny-based estimates of when transmissions occurred. We describe situations where caution is needed not to misinterpret which parts of a phylogeny that may indicate outbreaks and tight transmission clusters.},
